   http://my-json-server.typicode.com/fly365com/code-challenge/hotelDetails/{id}
- The user can change the number of nights and this will reflect on all hotels prices, the default is one night
- The user should find an image gallery for the hotel
- The user should see the comments divided into pages and each page contains 3 comments
- The user can sort comments based on comment score

- You can use any css framework
- ECMAScript 6 and beyond must be used
- Unit testing
- No plugin should be used for pagination and image gallery
- How will the components commuicate with each other ?
- Quality over quantity
